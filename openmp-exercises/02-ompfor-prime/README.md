OpenMP Parallel For: Primes
================================================================================

In this assignment you should parallelize a function that count how many primes
are below a certain threshold. See [Wikipedia][wiki] for an explanation on prime
numbers.

[wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_numbers

### Input

This application reads a number `N` from `stdin` and counts how many prime
numbers are below `2^N`.

### Output

The program will print a table where the first column is an integer `m`  and
the second column is the number of primes below `m`.

Tasks & Rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should do the following tasks:

- [ ] Understand the serial code in `src/prime-serial.c`
- [ ] Parallelize the code using OpenMP in the file `src/prime-parallel.c`
- [ ] Run both versions and compare them. Did you get any speedup?

You must **not** change the serial implementation, only the parallel one.

Grading
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your assignment will be evaluated in terms of:

- Correctness: your program returns the correct result;
- Performance: your program runs faster than the serial implementation.

In order to test your solution, you can use one of the inputs available inside
the `tests/` directory. 
Your grade will be computed using an automated routine restricted to the
instructors and TAs. This routine will be run after the assignment deadline,
using the latest commit push to the branch `main` before the deadline. Your
code will be ensured to run in an environment with no competition for resources.

**Note:** The automatic grading routine expect your the output of
your program to be formatted correctly. For that reason, you should not add
`printf`s or any other function that writes to `stdout`, otherwise your
assignment will be considered incorrect.

**Note:** Tampering with the serial implementation or the tests is considered
cheating and will result in disqualification of the assignment.

Compiling & Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you have accepted this assignment on the course's GitHub Classroom page,
clone it to your machine. First you have to generate the build system using
[CMake](https://cmake.org/). Make sure you have it installed! You will also need
an OpenMP compatible compiler. If you use Linux, you are good to go. For MacOS
users, you can install the OpenMP libraries via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
with the following command:

```bash
# Only for MacOS users
brew install libomp
```

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
# Where the build will live
mkdir build && cd build

# Generate the Makefiles
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

Having done that, still inside the `build` directory, run `make` to compile
everything. Finally, from the root directory of the repo you can execute the
serial and parallel versions like so:

```bash
build/serial tests/1.in
build/parallel tests/2.in
```

If you have any doubts or run into problems, please contact the TAs. Happy
coding! :smile: :keyboard:

instructor and the TAs would love to hear from you!
