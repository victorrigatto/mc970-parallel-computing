# OpenMP Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises focused on OpenMP parallel programming, split into multiple folders, each containing a specific exercise.

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise is located in a separate folder and contains the necessary files and instructions to complete it. The instructions for each exercise are located in a README file in the respective exercise folder

The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as each exercise builds upon the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you start with the first exercise and work your way through them in sequence.

## Grading

We will grade your program by checking the speedup and the correctness of the output. We will evaluate the main branch of the exercise repository.


## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository URL>
```

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the first exercise folder and read the instructions in the README file. Follow the instructions to complete the exercise, and then move on to the next exercise in the sequence.

## Prerequisites

To complete these exercises, you will need a basic understanding of C or C++ programming language and the fundamentals of parallel programming concepts. You will also need a development environment for the language used in the exercises and OpenMP libraries installed.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the exercises or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or pull request on this repository.
